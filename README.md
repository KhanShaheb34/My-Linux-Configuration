# Installation
As there are certain config which require reboot to work properly there is no one script that can do all the work so here we are....  <br>

1. First run: sh startupScript.sh  <br>
2. Then reboot  <br>
3. After that run: sh mainScript.sh  <br>
4. Reboot again (Please manually do this as this one will not prompt you to do so like other scripts do in this list...)  <br>
5. And lastly run: sh postScript.sh  <br>
6. Then reboot again  <br>
And........then you are done....... :)  <br>
