# My-Linux-Configuration
This is my custom configuration in a new linux distro...

# Installation
As there are certain config which require reboot to work properly there is no one script that can do all the work so here we are....

1. First run: sh startupPack.sh
2. Then reboot
3. After that run: sh myScript.sh
4. For some cleanup run: sh cleanup.sh
